# Description
Welcome to TitanicSurvivalPredictor! This project contains a machine learning model trained on the Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers during the tragic Titanic accident

# Features
Data Analysis and Visualization: Comprehensive analysis of the dataset with visualizations to understand the key factors affecting survival.
Data Preprocessing: Steps for cleaning and preprocessing the data to prepare it for model training.
Model Training: Implementation of RandomForestClassifier machine learning algorithms to predict passenger survival.
Prediction: A user-friendly interface or script to input passenger details and get survival predictions.
